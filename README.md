Submitted by: **David Barahona**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Waifu API** is an android app that **displays a random Waifu from the Nekos.best API")**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ’› ðŸ’š ðŸ’™**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] Changed launcher Icon

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **(https://nekos.best/api/v2/waifu)**.
